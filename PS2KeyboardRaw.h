  ** Mostly rewritten Paul Stoffregen <paul@pjrc.com>, June 2010
  ** Modified for use with Arduino 13 by L. Abraham Smith, <n3bah@microcompdesign.com> * 
  ** Modified for easy interrup pin assignement on method begin(datapin,irq_pin). Cuningan <cuninganreset@gmail.com> **
  ** Added raw events access by Athos Bacchiocchi <athos.bacchiocchi@gmail.com>, September 2015
	
  why a new library for raw input?
  could add the functions, but wanted to keep the lib small, and you probably know at "coding time"
  what you need, and you can switch the functions changing the names of the type and include
  int the sketch anyway.
